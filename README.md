## Introduction
During the working as IT Helpdesk, I've learned quite useful PowerShell script and the batch file. 
It saved me lot of time from repetitive tasks. 
I used PowerShell script and the batch file together, because some tasks can simply run with command line without the script.

## PowerShell Script
When you run powershell script, you need to setup your system that powershell script can run. 

## Tools
Any kinds of text editor your can use, but native Windows PowerShell may best choice in my ways
* **Windows PowerShell ISE** - Recommend, IDE and easy to use.
* Windows PowerShell
* VSCode + PowerShell extension - Good for long script file

## Batch File
Sometimes simple batch file might enough for simple task such as install programs. Also, batch file is very useful when you want to run mixed script files simultaneous

Example file is [here(PrintInstall.bat)](PrinterInstall.bat)
